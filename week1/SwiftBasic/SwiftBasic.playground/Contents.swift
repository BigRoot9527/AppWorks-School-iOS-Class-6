//3.
//change the types of constant x and y into Double
10/3
10/3.0
/* 10/3 can be converted to specified type Int(= 3) or Double(= 3.333),where 10/3.0 represend an Double type number that can only be converted to specified type Double */

//6.
// 0 is not false
//since "var check: Bool = 0" will causes a crash because of the type difference
